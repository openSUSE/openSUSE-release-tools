Testing
-------

Covering all functionality with test suite is currently work in
progress. In general new functionality should be covered by tests in
order to make sure we don't break it in future. Before refactoring,
functions has to be covered by tests as well to ensure we don't break
them.

How to work with test suite is better described in
link:docs/testing.asciidoc[testing] file in link:docs[docs] directory.
