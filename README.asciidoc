Factory workflow plugin
=======================

This repository contains mainly plugin which will be used in new
https://progress.opensuse.org/workflow/factory-proposal.html[factory workflow]
to work with staging projects. This is currently highly work in progress and
it builds on top of various tools that we accumulated over the past. These
legacy tools are for now included in this repository for reference as well, but
over the time as staging plugin will be taking over their functionality, they
will get removed.

This repository might also contain temporally scripts that will implement
functionality we need from OBS. These are going to be workarounds only for time
being and once functionality will get properly included in OBS, these helper
scripts will get dropped as well.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory.git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link the +osc-staging.py+ either to +~/.osc-plugins+ or +/var/lib/osc-plugins+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd osc-plugin-factory
ln -sr ./osc-staging.py ./stagingapi.py ~/.osc-plugins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you are done and all that is left is start using plugin, see help in
regards of what you can do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
osc help staging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing
-------

Covering all functionality with test suite is currently work in progress. In
general new functionality should be covered by tests in order to make sure we
don't break it in future. Before refactoring, functions has to be covered by
tests as well to ensure we don't break them.

How to work with test suite is better described in
link:tests/README.asciidoc[README] file in link:tests[tests] directory.
